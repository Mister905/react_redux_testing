Jest is a JavaScript unit testing framework, used by Facebook to test services and React applications.

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output.

Both Jest and Enzyme are specifically designed to test React applications, Jest can be used with any other Javascript app but Enzyme only works with React.

npm run test

touch setupTests.js

npm i enzyme enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16

create Root.js to export give your test functions access to redux state

npm i axios redux-thunk moxios

the moxios package is used for API request testing because axios will not work within Jest's command line enviornment

moxios can be configured to intercept an HTTP request and simulate the expected response
